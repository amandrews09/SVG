# SVG
Module 10 Challenge - Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This SVG generator is a tool that creates Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files programmatically. This generator allow users to specify parameters such as shapes, colors, gradients, and text, and then automatically generate corresponding SVG code. This code can be easily embedded into web pages, providing scalable and resolution-independent graphics. SVG generators are commonly used for creating logos, icons, charts, and other graphical elements on websites and digital applications.
